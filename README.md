# Identifying Performance-Impacting Trends in Men's Professional Tennis (1995-2019)
# Introduction
The goal of this project was to identify and visually describe several major biodemographic trends in top level menâ€™s professional tennis over the past quarter century, and to conduct cursory exploration of correlates of the trends to player performance. This exploratory data analysis project was conducted as a first step in conceiving the framework for a machine learning-based match outcome prediction project, a summary of which can be found [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/Mens-Tennis-Prediction#readme).

## Methods
### Primary Objective and Data Sources
The primary data source was a ~100,000 match subset over a quarter-century (1996-2019) of [Jeff Sackmann's Association of Men's Tennis Professionals (ATP) data archive](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp). This primary source was supplemented with additions and corrections obtained directly from the [ATP data site](https://www.atptour.com/en/scores/results-archive). All data manipulation, processing, and analyses were conducted in the Python/Pandas environment and documented with Jupyter Notebooks (anaconda3).
