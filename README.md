# Identifying Performance-Impacting Trends in Men's Professional Tennis (1995-2019)
# Introduction
The goal of this project was to identify and visually describe several major biodemographic trends in top level menâ€™s professional tennis over the past quarter century, and to conduct cursory exploration of correlates of the trends to player performance. This exploratory data analysis project was conducted as a first step in conceiving the framework for a machine learning-based match outcome prediction project, a summary of which can be found here https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/Mens-Tennis-Prediction#readme
